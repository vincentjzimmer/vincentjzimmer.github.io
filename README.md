I work on embedded firmware in the Seattle, WA area.

I am presently a sr. principal engineer on firmware with Intel, for whom I've been employed since 1997.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York in 1992 and a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington in 1999.

I've written a few books, papers and patents you can find at https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9fW87_IAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra.
